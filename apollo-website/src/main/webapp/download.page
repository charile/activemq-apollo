    ### Source Code Distributions

    Some hard core folks prefer to [build it](community/building.html) themselves from a source code distribution:
    
    * [apollo-project-#{project_snapshot_version}-source-release.zip](http://repository.apache.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.apache.activemq&a=apollo-project&v=#{project_snapshot_version}&e=zip&c=source-release)
    * [apollo-project-#{project_snapshot_version}-source-release.tar.gz](http://repository.apache.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.apache.activemq&a=apollo-project&v=#{project_snapshot_version}&e=tar.gz&c=source-release)
    
    You could have also checked out the source code directly from our [source code repository](community/source.html)
